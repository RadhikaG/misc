Check out the list of bookmarks at `bookmarks.md`.

## To make your own list

Just do `python make_bookmarks.py [exported bookmarks in HTML format]`
to make your own public bookmarks list in Markdown. Only works using
Python 3.

**Make sure you go through the comments** in `make_bookmarks.py` before you
run it. It won't work without some minor modifications.
